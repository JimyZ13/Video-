This is a video web application that runs on the Twitch streaming API
In order to run the web app locally, use "npm start" if you dont have antdesign added to your npm/react framwork do a "npm add antd" to add the dependecies. 
The backend framework also requies a seperate setup of a MySQL database and instalation of Maven dependencies. Use a IDE to install all Maven dependencies and update the MySQL section in the web.xml to change to your own databse.
